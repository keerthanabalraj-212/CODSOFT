CodSoft Internship - Landing Page Development (Task 1)

During my internship at CodSoft, I successfully completed Task 1, which involved developing a professional and user-friendly landing page. This project allowed me to enhance my web development skills, particularly in HTML, CSS. I focused on creating a visually appealing design, ensuring responsive layout across different devices, and optimizing the page for better performance and user experience. This hands-on experience was invaluable in refining my technical abilities and understanding of modern web development practices.
